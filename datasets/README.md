Please place the competition zip here, and extract in this directory. 

The testing script is built with pre-defined dataset paths for this flow.

If you wish to store datasets differently, please also modify paths in ```test.py```.

Also, please ensure test images are for one competition at a time. The script checks for images recursively.
